For example, when you use your phone, AI helps in face unlock, voice assistants like Siri or Google Assistant, and even in typing suggestions. AI is not magic, but a way to teach computers to do tasks that need human intelligence.\nToday, AI is used almost everywhere. On social media, AI suggests posts and friends you may like. In shopping apps, AI shows products based on your interest. AI helps doctors find diseases faster by looking at medical images. It is also used in self-driving cars that can sense traffic and decide where to go. Many chatbots on websites are powered by AI to answer our questions quickly.\nAI saves time and makes life easy. It can do boring and repeated work quickly. AI can read large data and give useful results which humans may miss. In factories, AI robots help in making products faster and safer. AI also helps farmers to know when to water crops and protect them from pests. AI is becoming part of our daily life slowly but strongly.\nIn the future, AI will bring even more changes. Some people worry AI may take away some jobs, but it can also create new jobs. It is important to learn how AI works so we can use it properly. AI is a tool, and humans must use it wisely to help society.",

It is called “cloud” because we can access it from anywhere, just like seeing clouds in the sky. For example, when you save photos on Google Drive or watch movies on Netflix, you are using cloud computing.\nCloud computing saves space on our phones and computers. It also keeps data safe even if your device breaks. People can share documents easily using cloud apps like Google Docs. Big companies use cloud to keep their data and to run websites faster. The cloud can also give more storage and power when needed, which saves money.\nStudents use the cloud to do projects together, store notes, and submit homework online. Teachers use it to share study materials with students anytime. Apps like YouTube, Gmail, Facebook, and Instagram all run on cloud. Even banks use cloud to store customer details safely.\nIn the future, more people and companies will use the cloud because it is fast, cheap, and flexible. But it is important to protect cloud data from hackers. Learning about cloud computing is useful for students because it is part of almost every business today.",

For example, a smartwatch counts your steps and shows health tips on your phone. A smart bulb can be turned on or off by your phone even if you are not at home.\nIoT saves time and makes life easy. Smart fridges can tell when milk is over. Smart cars show traffic on screen so you can avoid busy roads. In cities, IoT helps control street lights and traffic signals automatically. Farmers use IoT to check soil and water plants only when needed. IoT helps in hospitals to watch patient’s health all the time.\nMany people use fitness bands to check heart rate. Homes have smart door locks that can be opened with phones. In offices, smart ACs turn off when no one is inside to save power. Even schools can use IoT to send messages to parents when students enter or leave school.\nIn the future, IoT will connect even more devices. It will help save energy, water, and time.

Cybersecurity uses tools and rules to stop them.\nToday, we use the internet for banking, shopping, studying, and even talking with friends. Without cybersecurity, hackers could steal money from bank accounts or share private photos. It is very important to keep data safe, especially for students and young people who use phones and social media daily.\nSimple steps help a lot: like using strong passwords, not sharing passwords with anyone, and not clicking unknown links. Keeping phones and computers updated is also important because updates fix old security problems. Using antivirus software keeps harmful files away.\nIn the future, as technology grows, hackers may also get smarter. More jobs will need cybersecurity experts to protect data.
