    "text":"Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating systems that can perform tasks that usually need human intelligence. These tasks include understanding language, recognizing patterns, solving problems, and making decisions. AI systems can process large amounts of data much faster than humans, and they can keep learning and improving without being told exactly what to do every time.\nOne common use of AI is in recommendation systems, such as those used by video streaming platforms. These systems study what you watch and suggest other videos you might enjoy. AI is also used in customer service through virtual assistants and chatbots that can answer questions instantly. In industries like healthcare, AI helps in predicting diseases and recommending treatments.\nAI can be divided into two types: narrow AI, which is designed to do a specific job like translating languages, and general AI, which aims to do any intellectual task that a human can do. While general AI is still in research, narrow AI is already widely used in daily life.\nAlthough AI can improve productivity and accuracy, it also raises concerns about privacy, bias, and job displacement.

Keeping phones and computers updated is also important because updates fix old security problems. Using antivirus software keeps harmful files away.\nIn the future, as technology grows, hackers may also get smarter. More jobs will need cybersecurity experts to protect data. Learning about cybersecurity helps everyone stay safe and helps students get jobs too.",

     "text":"Robotics is the study and creation of robots, which are intelligent machines designed to assist humans with a wide range of tasks. While some robots are built to resemble humans, many take on forms such as mechanical arms, wheeled platforms, or compact automated units. This field merges engineering, computer science, and electronics to design, program, and operate robotic systems.\nIn industries, robots assemble vehicles, package goods, and apply precise coatings. In healthcare, robotic systems enable surgeons to perform complex operations with enhanced safety. Domestic robots handle chores like cleaning floors, while space robots explore distant planets that humans cannot easily reach.\nRobots excel at tasks that are repetitive, hazardous, or physically demanding. They operate continuously without fatigue and can be adapted for specialized purposes, such as prosthetic limbs that respond to brain signals, helping people with disabilities. In public spaces like airports or malls, robots provide directions and information to visitors.\nLooking ahead, robotics may expand into teaching, elder care, and cooking. Students who learn robotics today could design the next generation of innovative machines. The field is rapidly advancing and offers exciting career opportunities.",
